<div class="About me">
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p> I'm Amalia, a molecular biologist turned into biological data analyst.
When I started my undergrad I was all about pipetting and PCRs, until I got
the programming bug in a C++ course (I don't remember much, sorry). I learnt
bits and pieces of Perl and Python on my own throughout my BSc. and MSc. Fortunately,
I came across a PhD project that allowed me to fully delve into programming and
data analysis to understand biological problems. I have worked with NGS, proteomics
and some imaging data </p>

<p>I am a classic indoor nerd and in my free time I enjoy books and games. However,
  I have been known to venture outside for good hiking routes and food</p>
