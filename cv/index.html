<div class="Summary">
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p> Currently I am a researcher at the London Institute of Medical Sciences.
    Although I am a molecular biologist by training, I have been interpreting and visualizing the genome-wide datasets I produce experimentally using R since I started my PhD.
    My research involves the use of statistics to interpret complex biological datasets to produce testable hypotheses, in close collaboration with other research groups.
    I am interested in applying and developing my programming and data analysis skills. </p>
